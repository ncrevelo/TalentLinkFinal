## Project Blueprint:  Next.js App with Firebase Authentication and Role-Based Access Control

**Project Goal:** Develop a Next.js web application with secure user authentication using Firebase, supporting both email/password and Google sign-in, and implementing role-based access control to manage user permissions.

**Technology Stack:**

*   **Frontend:** Next.js (React Framework)
*   **Backend/Authentication/Database:** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore)
*   **Styling:** CSS (Tailwind CSS or similar - TBD)
*   **Deployment:** Vercel or similar

**Core Features:**

*   User Authentication (Email/Password, Google Sign-in)
*   User Registration
*   Password Reset Functionality
*   Secure User Sessions
*   Role-Based Access Control
*   Protected Routes based on User Roles
*   Basic User Profile Management

**Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure**

*   Initialize Next.js project.
*   Set up Firebase project and integrate Firebase SDK.
*   Configure initial routing (e.g., Home, Login, Register).
*   Implement basic layout components.

**Phase 2: Firebase Authentication - Email/Password**

*   **Implement User Registration:**
    *   Create a registration form.
    *   Use Firebase `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` to create new users.
    *   Handle potential errors (e.g., email already in use, weak password).
    *   Redirect to a success page or login after registration.
*   **Implement User Login:**
    *   Create a login form.
    *   Use Firebase `signInWithEmailAndPassword` to authenticate users.
    *   Handle login errors (e.g., incorrect credentials).
    *   Redirect to a protected route on successful login.
*   **Implement Password Reset:**
    *   Create a "Forgot Password" link/page.
    *   Use Firebase `sendPasswordResetEmail`.
    *   Inform the user that an email has been sent.
*   **Manage User State:**
    *   Use Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` to listen for changes in the user's authentication state.
    *   Store user information (UID, email) in the application's state (e.g., using React Context or a state management library).

**Phase 3: Firebase Authentication - Google Sign-in**

*   **Configure Google Sign-in in Firebase:**
    *   Enable Google authentication provider in the Firebase console.
*   **Implement Google Sign-in Button:**
    *   Add a "Sign in with Google" button.
    *   Use Firebase `signInWithPopup` (or `signInWithRedirect` for mobile-friendly experience).
    *   Handle successful sign-in and errors.
    *   Ensure user data (UID, email, name) is captured.

**Phase 4: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

*   **Define User Roles:**
    *   Determine the different roles required for the application (e.g., `user`, `admin`, `editor`).
*   **Store User Roles:**
    *   Decide where to store user roles. Options include:
        *   Custom claims in Firebase Authentication tokens.
        *   A dedicated "roles" collection in Firestore linked to user UIDs.
        *   A field within the user document in Firestore.
    *   *Decision:* Use a field within the user document in Firestore for simplicity in this initial implementation.
*   **Assign Roles on User Creation/Update:**
    *   When a user registers or signs in via Google for the first time, assign a default role (e.g., `user`).
    *   Implement a mechanism for administrators to update user roles (if applicable in future phases).
*   **Implement Protected Routes:**
    *   Create a higher-order component (HOC) or a custom hook (`useAuth`) to check the user's authentication status and role before rendering a component or navigating to a route.
    *   Redirect unauthorized users to a login or "access denied" page.
*   **Implement UI Element Visibility based on Roles:**
    *   Conditionally render UI elements (buttons, links, content) based on the user's role.

**Phase 5: Refinement and Testing**

*   Add input validation to forms.
*   Implement error handling and user feedback.
*   Write unit and integration tests for authentication and RBAC logic.
*   Perform thorough testing across different browsers and devices.
*   Refine styling and user experience.

**Future Enhancements:**

*   More granular permissions within roles.
*   User profile editing.
*   Email verification.
*   Integration with other Firebase services (e.g., Cloud Functions for backend logic).
*   Improved error logging and monitoring.
*   Admin dashboard for managing users and roles.
